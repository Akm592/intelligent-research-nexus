"""
Core Utility Functions.

This module is a placeholder for common utility functions that might be shared
across multiple services or modules within the Intelligent Research Nexus application.

Examples of utilities that could be placed here include:
- Date/time formatting or manipulation.
- Complex string operations not specific to any domain.
- Data validation helpers beyond Pydantic models.
- Functions for generating consistent IDs or tokens (if not part of models.py).
