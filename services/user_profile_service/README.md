# Service: User Profile Service (Placeholder)

## Purpose

The User Profile Service is intended to manage user accounts, preferences, authentication, and personalization features within the Intelligent Research Nexus (IRN). **Currently, this service is a placeholder and its functionalities are not yet implemented.**

## Key Functionalities (Planned)

-   User registration and login.
-   Management of user profile information.
-   Storing user preferences (e.g., preferred research areas, notification settings).
-   Handling authentication and authorization.
-   Potentially storing user interaction history for personalization.

## API Endpoints

(None implemented yet. A health check endpoint like `GET /health` would be standard once developed).

## Dependencies

(None defined yet, but would likely include `core.config`, `core.models`, `core.supabase_client` for database interaction, and FastAPI).

## Configuration

(None defined yet, but would include database connection details and possibly JWT/auth related settings).
